## MyBusiness: Spring, JPA/Hibernate, H2 (Oracle compatibility)

Any kind of help for me to better understand the problem is welcome. Also pull requests, forks and so on ;)

## Getting started

Project is maven-based. So everything you need to get started is here. Just clone the project in your favourite IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans ...). Database schema ddl (Oracle) is under the test/resources/db folder. My intention was to make junit tests with H2 in-memory database but I had no luck with it :(

## Contributing

Some useful hints can be written to README.md file. Thank you.
